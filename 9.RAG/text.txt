''' Beneath the sun on grassy field,
Where dreams are tossed and fates are sealed,
The bowler runs with fire and pace,
Eyes locked upon the striker’s face.

The bat is raised, a silent vow,
To guard the crease, to strike, somehow.
With thundering cheers from every side,
The crowd becomes the roaring tide.

A flick, a drive, a soaring shot,
The ball takes flight—will it be caught?
A diving hand, a boundary rope,
Each moment laced with hope-on-hope.

The stumps stand tall like sentinels,
Guardians of a thousand tales.
The spinner loops a cunning spell,
A mystery only time can tell.

Each over builds a silent war,
Of skill and grit, and something more.
Cricket—it’s more than bat and ball,
It’s spirit, pride, and passion’s call.'''
